# The Gift Giving Project by Elizabeth Estefan

Mission: Redesign the gift-giving experience.

Summary:

For this project, we broke out in groups of two where both parties in the group acted as interviewer and the interviewee, switching roles in each step through the process. We started with an initial interview with the goal to “Redesign the Gift-Giving Experience.” The interviewee discussed what he calls his “Gift Giving Season.” I learned that the interviewee has many friends and family as well as holidays that all fall within a few months of each other. But he is currently living far from home, and wants a way to be able to send special gifts, not just a gift card. But he wants to be able to send tangible gifts without having to perform traditional tasks such as visiting stores in search of the gifts and spending time at a post office to ship them out.

At the start of the next step to “dig deeper” with a second interview, I wanted to check if I was understanding what the interviewee was sharing in the first round. I tried to gather my thoughts and shared back to the interviewee what I thought I was understanding as the gift giving need and goal. With this he was able to confirm and alter as needed what I was reflecting back. Also, during the first interview, I noticed that the interviewee often mentioned his mom and her love of greeting cards. I asked the interviewee, “What would you want to send your mom for a gift.” This help hone in closer to the interviewee’s need to refine the goal. Interviewee became more specific, sharing the desire to have a way to send a high end personalized card, especially to his mom who cherishes greeting cards.

During the interviews, it was important to listen carefully and ask open-ended questions to allow the interviewee space to gather and share thoughts. And I learned it important to not lead or persuade the answers through questions, but rather use questions like “How do you feel about that? Tell me more about it?” And being down-to-earth, feeling comfortable through the process, I believe helped make a connection and make the interviewee feel comfortable to share. 

As the interviewee, I found it important to be thoughtful with my words. And I discovered my interviewer was able to perceive a need for me that was not in my focus. 

In the next steps, “capture findings—goals, wishes and insights” and “take a stand with a point-of-view” it helped me to create a list of the top needs I perceived for the interviewee and steps closer to the goal(s). 

I struggled a bit through the ideation/sketches stage. I felt I was being too safe and not producing enough solutions. I need to reinforce that it is okay to allow the off-the-wall ideas to come in which may later be reimagined/modified into feasible solutions

Upon sharing my solution ideas with the interviewee, he liked a few of the solutions which were later combined to create a new solution.
